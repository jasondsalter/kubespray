Exposing Non-HTTP Services with Metal LB
The MetalLB Component

MetalLB is a load balancer component that provides a load balancing service for clusters that do not run on a cloud provider, such as a bare metal cluster, or clusters that run on hypervisors. MetalLB operates in two modes: layer 2 and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), with different properties and requirements. You must plan the use of MetalLB to consider your requirements and your network design.
MetalLB is an operator that you can install with the Operator Lifecycle Manager. After installing the operator, you must configure MetalLB through its custom resource definitions. In most situations, you must provide MetalLB with an IP address range.

Resource limits - Maximum Resources
Resource Requests -Workloads can decalre there minimum required resources
Example
        OS    oc set resources deployment/nginx --limits=cpu=200m,memory=512Mi --requests=cpu=100m,memory=256Mi   
        k8s   kubectl set resources deployment/nginx --limits=cpu=200m,memory=512Mi --requests=cpu=100m,memory=256Mi

      oc get quota one-cpu -o yaml

if you use the vi editor, then you can use the following procedure to move a block of text:

    Move to the beginning of the block.
        Press V to enter visual line mode. This mode selects entire lines for manipulation.
    Move to the end of the block. The editor highlights the selected lines.
        Press d to delete the lines and to store them in a register for later use.
    Move to the destination.
        Press P to insert the lines that are stored in the register.
You can also press dd to delete entire lines, and press . to repeat the operation.

Chapter 7 - Operators
    Extend the Kubernetes API Extensions - Allows users to use custom resouces

    Cluster Operators   Cluster operators provide the platform services of OpenShift, such as the web console and the OAuth server.
                        oc get co
    Add-On Operators    OpenShift includes the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). The OLM helps users to install and update operators in a cluster.
    Other Operators     custom
    Operator Lifecycle  Manages Add-Ons 
    Manager        

    View Catalog Sources (for other mirrors) - like a repo
    Examine catalog sources in the openshift-marketplace namespace to know which catalog sources are available in a cluster.
            oc get catalogsource -n openshift-marketplace

    View available operators
    The OLM creates a package manifest for each available operator. The package manifest contains the required information to install an operator, such as the        available channels.List the package manifests to know which operators are available for installation.
            oc get packagemanifests

    Operator Group    
            Operator groups define how the OLM presents operators across namespaces.

    Subscription
            Cluster administrators create subscriptions to install operators

    Operator
            The OLM creates operator resources to store information about installed operators.

    Install Plan
            The OLM creates install plan resources as part of the installation and update process. When requiring approvals, administrators must approve install              plans.

    Cluster service version (CSV)
            Each version of an operator has a corresponding CSV. The CSV contains the information that the OLM requires to install the operator.
    

    To install manaually via manifest
            oc create ns "name"
            oc create operator-group            Operator groups define how the OLM presents operators across namespaces
            oc create subscription
